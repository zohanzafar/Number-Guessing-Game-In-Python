# Number-Guessing-Game-In-Python
This project is a simple "Number Guessing Game" developed as a practice project during Semester 1 for the course "Programming Fundamentals" in Python Programming Language.

The game prompts the player to enter a lower and upper bound for the range of numbers to guess from. Then, a random number within this range is selected. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player narrow down the range. If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, they win the game; otherwise, the game ends, revealing the correct number.

This project serves as a beginner-level exercise to practice fundamental programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation.
